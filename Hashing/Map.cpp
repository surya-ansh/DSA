-> Map stores value in key pair form 
-> key stores the element ans value store the frequency

-> map gives the freq 0 of element that is not stored in ap as key


for characters
-> map<char, int> mapping
-> mapping stores the frequency of char like a, b, c, d, etc
-> also map stores the key(element) in ordered fashion
-> Time complexity = O(logN);

Unordered Map
-> stores key(element) in unordered fashion
-> Time complexity = O(N); in worst case and O(1) in best case
